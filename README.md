stome
=====

Stome is a stand-alone link tagging program written in Java, somewhat like the web-app Delicious.

COMPILE

"./build.sh" (minus the parentheses) in the project directory should build Stome.jar.

RUN

Start Stome with "java -jar Stome.jar". A default Sqlite3 database (Stome.db) will be created in the working directory when this is run, unless another Stome database is specified with the -d switch.

For command-line options run "java -jar Stome.jar -h"
